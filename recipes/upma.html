                        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
                        <li>8 to 10 curry leaves</li>
                        <li>10 to 12 cashews</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon chana dal (hulled and split bengal gram)</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon urad dal (hulled and split black gram)</li>
                     </ul>

                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                          <ol>
                             <li>Prep the ingredients first to make upma recipe. Take 1 cup rava (fine variety) and set it aside. Next gather the aromatics, lentils, nuts, spices and herbs ready. </li>
                             <li>Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of wheat (fine variety).</li>
                             <li>Begin to roast the rava. Stir often while roasting the rava.</li>
                             <li>The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry, separate and crisp. Don’t brown the rava.</li>
                             <li>Once the rava becomes fragrant and starts to look dry and crisp, switch off the flame and put the roasted rava on a plate and set aside.</li>
                             <li>In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil. You could use sunflower oil or peanut oil or safflower oil or any neutral tasting oil.</li>
                             <li>Lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, it means they are getting fried.</li>
                             <li>Now add the ½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon urad dal (husked and split black gram).</li>
                             <li>Stirring often fry until the chana dal and urad dal begin to brown a bit.</li>
                             <li>Immediately add 10 to 12 cashews and begin to fry on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
                             <li>By the time the cashews get golden the dals should also be golden.</li>
                             <li>Now add the finely chopped onions.</li>
                             <li>Sauté the onions until they soften and become translucent on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
                             <li>Then add the chopped green chillies, ginger and curry leaves. You can also add 1 dried red chilli at this step.</li>
                             <li>Mix well & sauté for a few seconds.</li>
                             <li>Then add 2.5 cups water to this mixture.</li>
                             <li>Add salt as required. Mix well and check the taste of water. It should be a bit salty but not too much.</li>
                             <li>Then add 1 teaspoon sugar. Sugar is optional and you can skip it. We prefer a slight sweet taste in the upma and hence we add it.</li>
                             <li>Stir again. On a medium to high flame, heat the water and let it come to a rolling boiling.</li>
                             <li>When the water comes to a rolling boil, lower the flame to its lowest. Then add the rava in 4 to 5 batches with a spoon.</li>
                             <li>Once you add the first batch of rava, stir and mix immediately so that the roasted rava gets mixed evenly with the water.</li>
                             <li>Then add the next batch of rava. Mix and stir again very well ensuring that the batch of rava is mixed evenly in water.</li>
                             <li>Continue to add and stir the rava up to the last batch.</li>
                             <li>Quickly stir and mix very well. The rava grains will absorb water, swell and get cooked.</li>
                             <li>Cover and allow the rava upma to steam for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat.</li>
                             <li>Then switch off the heat.The rava is cooked well and the suji ka upma is ready.</li>
                             <li>Lastly add about 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro). You can add more coriander leaves if you like.</li>
                             <li>Mix again.</li>
                             <li>Serve upma hot or warm with slices of lemon or a side of lemon pickle or coconut chutney.</li>
                             <li>You can opt to drizzle half to one teaspoon of ghee while serving.If you like you can garnish with some coriander leaves.</li>
                         </ol>
